# DeepLearningExercises
A series of deep learning exercises from deeplearning.ai on Coursera where I code deep learning algorithms from scratch. 
After a series of exercises where I learn to code the base of NN models, I then untilize the Keras library to develop more intricate models and experiment with hyperparameters. 
This repo contains music generation, art generation, translation models, text categorization, image classification, word generation, and more.
